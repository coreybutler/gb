												<h2>Online Recording Sessions</h2>
											</header>
											<h3><a id="drumtracks">Custom Drum Tracks</a></h3>
											<p>
												A great recording starts with great performances, and one of the most important (and most often overlooked) aspects of a recording is the drum tracks. A great drum track provides the feel and power (or sensitivity) that drives a song.
											</p>
											<p>
												Programmed drums are sounding better than ever, but they still cannot provide the depth of feel and the touch a real drummer is capable of. Great drummers are few and far between, and if you do manage to find one, getting him/her into a studio to record can be an expensive and time-consuming proposition.
											</p>
											<p>
												That's where I come in. I have a studio full of drums ready to record, and you can take advantage of my experience and expertise as a drummer and recording engineer to create drum tracks that are custom-tailored to your songs. Here are some reasons to choose me:
												<ul class="style1">
													<li>
														<strong>Detail is everything:</strong>
														<ul class="no-style inner">
															<li>I believe that the right drum part and the right sound is key to bringing out the best in a song. I will develop a drum part that serves the emotion and style of your song, taking the following into account: 
																	<ol class="style1 inner">
																		<li>Drum and cymbal selection</li>
																		<li>Drum tuning and cymbal pitch-matching</li>
																		<li>Microphone selection and positioning</li>
																		<li>Mic Pre/EQ/Compression chain</li>
																	</ol>
															</li>
														</ul>
													</li>
													<!-- <li>
														<strong>"Drum Presets":</strong>
														<p>
															I offer several "presets" to start from. These are tried-and-true recording setups that will work in many different situations. Want a big, roomy rock sound? Check. A vintage, dirty or lofi sound? Got it. How about a tight, punchy pop sound? Just say the word. This will give you an idea of what you can expect in the final result, so there is no guesswork involved.
														</p>
													</li> -->
													<li>
														<strong>Expert recording techniques:</strong>
														<p>
															In addition to drumming, I have worked as an engineer and producer for over ten years in <a href="studio.html">my own studio and others</a>.  You can rest assured you will get tracks recorded at optimal levels with no undesireable clipping, distortion, or artifacts; Guaranteed.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<strong>Options, options, options:</strong>
														<p>
															I have a wide variety of drums, cymbals and percussion instruments to work with, so you can count on getting the right sounds.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<strong>Extras:</strong>
														<p>
															For each song, you have additional options:
															<ol class="style1 inner">
																<!-- <li><strong>Pre-mixing:</strong> In addition to the raw drum tracks, you can choose to have your tracks pre-treated with eq and compression. </li> -->
																<li><strong>Beat Detective / Time Alignment:</strong> If your music is strongly quantized to a grid, I can do the work of time-aligning the drum part to match perfectly with your sequenced tracks.</li>
																<li><strong>Sampled Hits:</strong> You can choose to have soft, medium, and loud hits on each drum and cymbal, recorded separately, to use for sample replacement or edits. You are also free to use the samples in later projects.</li>
																<li><strong>Loop Construction:</strong> If your arrangement is not yet finalized, I can create drum loops that you can use to build it up.</li>
															</ol>
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<strong>Mixing &amp; Mastering</strong>
														<p>
															Got all your tracks recorded but aren't able to get the project finalized?  Take advantage of my <a href="services.html">Mixing &amp; Mastering services</a> to take your project to the next level.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<strong>Satisfaction Guaranteed or you don't pay:</strong>
														<p>
															I understand how important your music is to you.  Because of this, I will do up to two additional takes for every song, free of charge.  If you still aren't happy with the results, you don't pay a cent. Guaranteed.
														</p>
													</li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<h3><a id="musos">Session Musicians</a></h3>
											<p>
												Need more than just drum parts? Take advantage of my network of studio musicians. Whether you have a written part you need played, or just need some options to work with, I can connect you with the right musicians for the job.  I will then record them using the same principles and approach I use for drum tracking.
											</p>
											<!-- <h3><a id="studiohub">StudioHub&trade;</a></h3>
											<p>
												Online sessions can sometimes turn into a nightmare of miscommunication and lost files. When you work with me you get exclusive access to StudioHub&trade; which handles all communications, file transfers, payment and session management from one easy-to-use app. Your session gets its own secure website where you can log in and have instant access to everything, making for a smooth experience from start to finish.

												<h2>How it Works</h2>
											</header>
											<p>
												I understand how important your music is to you.  Because of this, you don't pay unless you are completely happy with the results.  If not, no problem!
											</p>
											<p>
												If you would like me to mix or master your project, please <a href="#footer">Contact me</a> with the following information:
												<ul class="style1">
													<li>Project type: Mixing, Mastering, or both; single track or group of tracks, EP, full-length record, commercial spot, voiceover, etc.</li>
													<li>Music style or genre</li>
													<li>Band/Artist name (if applicable)</li>
													<li>Approximate length of all material</li>
													<li>Deadline or timeframe for completion</li>
													<li>Approximate budget</li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<p>
												I will respond ASAP to discuss the project in further detail.  Once we have decided on a course of action, I will set up your StudioHub&trade; page which, as its name suggests, will act as the "hub" for the session.  All file transfers, session specifics, and payment will be handled through this page.
											</p>
											<p>
												I like to keep things running smoothly and efficiently; Every project makes use of my proprietary "StudioHub&trade;" technology which allows the whole process to be managed through a secure website/mobile app.  From concept to file transfer to payment, every aspect of your session is accessible and manageable at the tap of a finger.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong>To get started:</strong>
												<ol class="style1">
													<li>
														<a href="#footer">Contact me</a> with the following information about your project:
														<ul class="style1">

															<li>Deadline or timeframe for completion</li>
															<li>Approximate budget</li>
														</ul>
														I will respond to you with additional questions, and we will discuss timeframe &amp; payment options.
													</li>
													<li>Once an agreement on timeframe and payment has been made, I will set up your session on StudioHub&trade;.  I will provide you with a link to your personalized StudioHub&trade; page, where you will be able to create an account for secure access.</li>
													<li>Once you have created and logged into your StudioHub&trade; account, you can proceed to upload your session files.</li>
													<li>I will do a mix or master and add an mp3 to your StudioHub&trade; account.  If you are happy with the results, you can approve the mix and we will move onto the next steps.  Otherwise, you can leave comments and feedback.  Each mix can have up to two (2) revisions.  If you would like a revision, we will repeat this step</li>

															<a href="http://www.dreadfascination.com" target="_blank">Dread Fascination</a> is my free-to-listen debut album. It represents a unique approach to concept albums, with no characters and no dialogue; Instead, it attempts to tell a story through different perspectives, bringing to light the thoughts & emotions that come about from experiencing tragic or life-altering events. It explores themes of love, loss, depression, death & rebirth, and the process of finding purpose and fulfillment in the face of life's resistance.
